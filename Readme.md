# Approch To Solve -:
1. Install Nodejs and download the node-scheduler.
2. Make a items file, which have list of events in a format of 
   {
    text: "textOne",
    dateTime: "2022-03-18 08:10:00.00",
   }
3. I used node-scheduler here to find the date and time.
4. Making reverse function to reverse the text.
5. For stopping the event used .cancel()
